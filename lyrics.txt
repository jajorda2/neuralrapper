Yeah, this record's for my baby, my baby boo
I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone
And you say I'll never make records for you no more
Well this record is from me to you baby
Yeah, real talk

Been around tha world
I've been into many places seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

I seen everything twice
Been around tha world, I've seen every scene twice
Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice

I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas
Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted ...

I'm sorta like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy
Sipping Chardinae, making deals on my hands free
Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me
'Cause I own rap and I'm coming for your day job

Until then I'm chilling at the day spa
Relax my mind and just chill
'Cause without you none of this is real
Baby you know I

Been around tha world
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

Yeah, but now I'm back across the water
I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter
Blowing sticky by the zips and they can tell
By my rag hanging, fuck this is Crip, but I'm chilling

It feels so good to get away
Especially when your name is D O double Gizzee
Coast to coast jetting, man I been doing that
What's up, just start balling ... I been around the track

Hop in Peas with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office
Docking down in Monaco, churching with my folks
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat

My life is like a movie
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill
'Cause without you none of this is real
Baby you know I

Been around tha world
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

Been around tha world
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

Just for you baby
Yeah, I'm on my way home right now
I'm on my way right now
I'm leaving the studio right now

Yeah, soon as I get home tomorrow I'ma go unplug it
Matter of fact I ain't even gonna bring it in the house
See you in a minute

Intro:
G, LBC, remember how it used to be?
Mmm, you remember so much

'cause we all one love and yeah this tha dub
On my eleven gettin slicker
Buyin liquor from a non-liquor store
Quick to dick a hoe and get tha big homie for a 64
He ain't gon miss it though
'cause I'm too slick for him to notice it was gone
But I ed up and scraped his chrome
Now he's tryin to take my dome
Hangin out all in front of my home
Now I got to getsome of my chrome on my own
Now it's really on
'cause I'm a dome this nigga and get him for his 
Put tha switches on his riches
Now his bitch is my bitch
Ain't that a trip how I'm a crip
But I won't hesitate to test another rip
See thats the plan I was brainwashed not to know
But nigga what you goin through this 2-0
And by tha time I'm 17 if I ain't in tha pin
I'm on a mission wit tha homeboys mashin again
Ridin, hoo-bangin like Mack 10
Back on tha streets again and strapped in
I'm lookin for tha niggas wit tha wrong fingas up
Nigga I don't give a, nigga I don't give a em
Straight bang, bang, bang, bangin, bangin

Chorus:
Shoot em up, shoot em up bang bang
It's all fair in tha gang bang
x2

I feel like livin it up
I mean will like livin it up, you know
Bang to tha boogie and boogie to tha bang
Tha sound of mi nina when she feel tha need to sang

I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now

Not to mention tha homeboys locked down in tha p now
See now tha road get shaky but you can't break
Watch out for them hoodrats, snakes
Cus E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt
The lil homie did too much dirt and got worked
Now he's on the run and dyin of thirst
Stayin at his s spot on 21st
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst
'cause he might not make it to tha last verse
But meanwhile back in tha p now
Me and my niggas is representin LBC style
Straight hoo-bangin and slangin cigarettes
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep
We straight bangin

*Chorus x4

This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life, yeah right
What you join tha game for you lil busta
Now you wanna cross us out and disrespect us
Musta thought we was bustas or sumthin
I drop two niggas I don't need you niggas
Thats tha one thang I learned about tha gang bang
If you gon gang bang
Ya gots to be able to bang like yourself man
So whether you bangin for crip or 
You better bang for sumthin young thug
'cause you'll get banged on not by bangas
But by Johnny Law 'cause they love to hang us I hear

I ride wit ya dogg if you can get me to tha border
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my
daughter
I oughta trip on that bitch I oughta flip on that
bitch
I can't trip 'cause she look like my daughter and 
So I'm a load up my clip and go ridin high
And every police car that I see ridin by
I autograph their car wit my brand new lid
Drinkin to tha set and hope my dogg young have head
Throwin up DPG for L-I-F-E 'cause thats all I see
Wit love for the LB

At your local liquor store, we gettin some optimals, and

Snoop Dogg: " Keep it on the low, on the w-w-w-west coast

I think you all need to know."

(Chorus)

Snoop Dogg: " On the One-Ten freeway floating back to the block

[Chorus: Tray Deee]
I'm tired of that punk shit
Where niggaz claim to done, where they from and who run shit
I bang it to the tip-top
Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks
To the last drip-drop
To the, tick tock to the blocks niggaz rip glocks
I'm knowin that this shit hot
This your first introduction to this motherfuckin crip hop

[Tray Deee]
It's time to research the documents and pull some files
and put it down with this gangsta style
Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now
after peace treaty meetings and the weapons down
Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals
To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless
To manage this dramaticness I call my rep
Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check
Certified murder guide through the streets of death
Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash
Niggaz have done did when the steel'll blast
Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag
Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock
Lick shots and the cops and control your block
Keep it true with the crew from the old to new
Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do
Notice who, participatin all the activity
That's how we livin G, strictly killer tendencies
So death to all my enemies
And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy
These weak niggaz killin me
with their proclivity to even proclimate that they as real as me

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah nigga this crip, crip, crip
Talk shit and I'ma bust yo' lip
I'm gettin chips in the summer in a nine-six Hummer
in D.C., fuckin with a breezy, easy
See we see all we can see
G.R. we can G, the Eastside family
Coherent, cohesive, the co-pilot
On this Eastside shit cuz, I'm co-signin
On the East fuck peace we ridin violent
Fuck where you been it's all about where I been
Sirens, gunshots, flood glocks get popped
when they all try to knock knock knock
Who is it - visit the papers, the streets and the labels
We got the hottest shit burnin on the turntables
I won't deny ya, I'm a straight rider
and you don't wanna fuck with me (yeh yeh)

[Chorus]

[Goldie Loc]
C.. R.. I.. P.. cause that's all we G
I'm from Rollin', 20, Gangsta Crip
and I'ma tell you how the shit gon' C (gon' C)
Now if I wasn't rappin motherfucker y'all be starvin
on my nuts without bucks like Marvin
You can't sleep, you can't eat, look who starvin
Written bill paid but still gotta be a slave
Flip your own money, make your own proper
Get yo' own heat, in case some niggaz try to stop ya
Be a boss hog about your money, float loc
And trust no one, anybody can get smoke smoked
like a fat-ass blunt, of that bomb shit
Have a babysitter set that ass up for chip Chips Ahoy!
Niggaz ran in with toys
If you didn't see 'em it's the Eastside boys
We be mobbin, like a motherfuckin cut
Dirty dealt, lil' sag, lil' jay, lil' Chuck
Two times, trey times on yo' motherfuckin ass
Keep it O.G. nigga, rewind and pass
It's just another day and forty dozen, niggaz strugglin
Is you hustlin, do you relate to drug smugglin?
If so, grab a nine and start to trip
But remember, don't let nobody punk you out yo' grip nigga

[LaToiya Williams]

Since I was the first, I guess I'll be the last to leave
D-O-double-G, will you keep it gangsta please

[Snoop]
I gots to do it
Yes Yes loc', we keep the best smoke
Me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk
I kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke
I'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke
You want a problem, then lets go
Cause if not I came to disco
And freak this ho from Acopoqo
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride
Let's go we hit the hood slow
Post up, set up shop and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know
Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke
But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast
In the summertime
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless
Square biz, you know what time it is
I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch

Hook: Soopafly & Latoiya Williams

Electrifying, death-defying, yeah, that's the science
Defined with no compliance but my alliance
I'm cold with it, roll with it, so go get it
Take some, bass drum, so vivid
Picture that, sunset, flowers, and trees
Hydraulics and Parliament, Impala with parlor seats
Follow the policy, this a little DP-ology
Dress code, cut-off khakis with Wallabees
Yes sir, we does the most
So I'd like to give a toast to the coast, black excellence

[Snoop Dogg]
The feeling is fine once you fill in the line
Ain't no blank spots, just all go tank tops
I'm realer than real and my word is my bond
Pop a bottle of Don and blow a blunt with LeBron
I'm on my way to the tip, ain't no cookies and milk
Just satin and silk, I look for my quill
We writing the script, flipping the shit like a flapjack
Boss lady, that's my queen, blackjack
21, get it done, we having fun
Make dough, legs show, let's make a run
Real talk, boss dog, you are the one
The star, the light, and the Sun

[Snoop Dogg]
When we niggaz, ever learn
That time is money, and money gets your ass burned
Learn from the niggaz that done it, before I had a chance
You know the ones, with the Chuck's and the khaki pants
Use to tell me all the time, bang lil' man
Took your advice, now my life is a paradise
Half of it, ghetto fabulous
Established, since 1992

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
Make way for the Dirty South representer, who next to be
I'm from the H, where these niggaz'll hide ya under the streets
I remember coming up, from on the corner with thugs
The only love that they had, was lost and scattered with slugs
Never ever getting caught slipping, I'm packing my chrome
Come at me wrong, I'll have these niggaz packing your dome
Asshole By Nature, bitch better give me fifty feet
'Fore my thugs click up, and hit your block fifty deep

[Yung Redd]
I use to sit back, let them old niggaz hold the spot
17, when I worked my first dope spot
Now let me teach ya how to stunt, how to hold a glock
7-1-3, I can't sleep till I see a knot
I'm seeing y'all gangsta, for the time being
You wonder who gon save you, when I'm not screaming
Any time of the day, I'll let that drama play
You can lay low, but I know where your mama stay

[T.C.]
Know how we roll, bitch nigga can't get away
T.C. hit your block, won't see another day
Still in the game, running shop still making moves
Running with Suga Slim, bitch bet pay my dues

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 1]
Stacey Boots, perms and suits, I'm braided up, can fade it up
I skated up, you waited up, so you know I got to go ahead and tear shit up
Turn lose on these muthafuckers Jelly Roll
Nephew, boy this shit is out of control
Rockin, rollin, bangin b
A little something, something nigga, thats banged up streets
Freak, freak yall, into the beat ya'll
And to all my big doggs grab your meat cha'll
And yes, yes ya'll, oh we the best ya'll
We got the shit that make the bitches grab they breast ya'll
It don't stop till the wheels fall off
954 headed swervin in the goodin clinic, tryin keep it hot right
Fuckers spot light, my nigga Jelly Roll make it knock light

[Chorus]
We all shinin' stars
Ya'll know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.

[Verse 2]
We ridin, dippin, slippin, slidin, eastside up eastsiders
Riders, ballers, rollers, ladies,
players, gangstas, macks, pimps, and 'llacs
Hustlers, bitches, niggas and G's, we having big thangs blowing trees
Shinin, grinin, refuse to lose
I gotta a G in my pocket for dippin out of shoes
I head the corner in the Navigator
Committed to excellence like a Raider
You hate a nigga like me but you got to love me
Your lady wanna shove me and your kids wanna hug me
A nigga fuckin like Buggsy Seagal again, I'm in the ringle again
I do it all legal again, I can't lose you won't win, respect the boss
If you run up, you gettin done up, I love to floss

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why you acting bad, probably cause I'm know as the bad actor
In the rap game I'm the big factor, macker, smack a bitch in a second
The big dogg nigga very well respected
You gotta put your mash down when you wanna get to the top
The game is stuffy like Puffy don't stop
I thought I told ya, nigga I'm a soldier
No Limit Lieutenant, yeah I did it
I'm committed like a motherfucker supposed to be
Won't let no bitch niggaz close to me
From my head to my feet I'm protected from harm
Cause I'm a muthafucking shining star, you feel me
And fuck who wanna kill me
you niggaz thrill me, but guess what will be
On top tip top, non stop, dogg not
And you gotta let me end, the nigga I'm a shine like a G

[Chorus]

Uugh, yeah
Snoop, kells, once again
And this is for the non-believers
That seem to think that pimping is easy
Aiyyo uncle snoop
Let's go get these knuckleheads
Pop bottles (pop bottles)
Shake hands (shake hands)

Recognise (recognise) I'm the man
I try to tell 'em but they won't understand
That pimping ain't easy
I got money (got money)
I got cars (got cars)
Still fucking with them hood superstars (superstars)
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar
Like pimping ain't easy

Well it ain't
All them faces in that laker paint
Casa by the lake
Make a little nigga faint
Balling is what I does
I ain't messing with you can'ts
I'm a can do negro
A real life california hero
About six zeros at the end of the number

In my bank account
Nigga ain't ya mad at me
I'm so happy to see
That you stopped your life to watch mine
Yeah you see it fool
Snoop's everywhere, italy I'm heavy there
Did a show in rome like ho say you ain't never there
Talking 'bout you popping bottles
I don't see none

You made it rain where?
I don't see a wand
Go on get it off
That's what they like to hear
It's your money pimp
We don't fight it here
It's hard enough to be me
Not trying to be you is someting I got to see
Until then I'mma

This ain't a joke a loc made it look easy to you
I been through some shit
I made it easy for ya
Now you ain't got to do much, I pop at everybody
Go unwrap a bottle, share it with them busybodies
Tell 'em what she want to hear
How you would like to take her out of town and shopping here
And snoopy is your homie
Nah nah girl he out of here

Yeah he just act like he don't know me when he all up in here
You a fool jack
Though I don't condone faking for a bitch
Don't call it pimping
When you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch
Go ahead and talk money
Talk, look at the chicks it brought
But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for
I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool
I pop cause I'm the man
Now watch me and kells

I got pimping in my veins
Pimping in my blood
Pimping in my swag
Pimping in my cup
Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love
Pimp by day, pimp by night

Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight
See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug
Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck
But I ain't on that shit so I'mma throw my hands up
And keep it sexy pimping cause thats how I does
Uncle snoop say kells go hard or go home
Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here

To all my honeys in the club getting money with the thugs
Keep it pimping baby
Keep it pimping baby
Southside, westside, eastside, northside
Keep it pimping baby
Keep it pimping

[verse one:]

[static]
Pump pump, pump pump, pump pump, pump pump
Pump pump

Let the motion of your body be the key, cuz we
Be the motherfuckin g funk family
Now, i'll play the g in this deadly game
Snoop dogg is the name dogg pound's the game
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin nother
Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother
Whether standin on the corner, or bouncin in the six-deuce
When i was locked up, i couldn't wait to get loose
Cuz back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And i was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go
Rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall
Can't none of y'all niggaz see the doggy dogg
Cuz i'm one rude bwoy comin with the wickedness
So shut the fuck up, and listen while i'm kickin this

[chorus: (repeat 2x)]

Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga doggy dogg (pump pump)

[verse two: snoop]

Now you can look to the sun, and spot the moon
And see snoop doggy dogg step into the room
With the g funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
Follow me, follow me, listen to the words that a nigga...
I come down with the wickedness
One rude bwoy comin with the darkness (blam!)
Close your eyes cuz you can't see me
I quit school cause of recess you fuckin b.g.
I'm shakin up the party, like lodi dodi
Is he the dopest? ya betta ask somebody
When, then, send, some gin
And a pack of zig zags now let the games begin
In nineteen-motherfuckin-ninety-three
I'm fuckin up every nigga known in the indistry
Check this out, it's a dogg pound thang
You know who i am you know my motherfuckin name, who am i?
(the s-n-double-o-p) nickname (silky smell) last name (d-o-double-g)
The behavior and the flavor that i found
Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the dogg pound

[chorus]

[verse three: malik]

Now just back up, don't act up, i pack up much heat
Any battle i'm in, i win, i can't be beat
Don't sleep while i creep peep out my technique
I forgot, i'm out of sight so you can't see the
Mc of the year, you hear and you fear
I got somethin for them niggaz in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a driveby in the who-ride
I'm satisfied now everything is really alright
You know when i come nigga i come wicked
Don't need no permisison, motherfucker i'ma kick it
Niggaz sweat my shit i wet em up with the biscuit
Lick em up shot, it don't stop, till dem all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop, rottin on the next niggaz jock
I'm strapped with my glock on your block
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that i spot

Get stuck in the ribs by old bone crusher
2 tone leather with a soul of a hustler
Tryna stack mail stealin clothes from my brother
People wanna know am i close to my mother
I'm a premature baby i'm ahead of the others
Yes i'm aware of the gutter
Ahead of my time, the games gettin smothered
I stay on the grind but it's only gettin rougher
Niggas think i'm playin til they smokin like a muffler
Bout to take flight the name open on you bustas
Catch me if you can in a world full of suckaz
Niggaz keep sniffin, they wanna be usher
Until they get they eyes and coffin closed by the usher
Them punches won't work you need more muster
Lord lay em down he need no sufferin

[chorus]:
Ridin in my chevy and i'm sittin at the light (at the light)

Hmm... on my road to riches

But niggas don't know when to listen
That's why i load ammunition and stay in touch with my competition

Roll a blunt, it's the kush

Pick a side, yeah you know we crippin
And thru my eyes i see the world different

Six million ways to die, choose one

[verse one: kurupt, daz]

It's time to escape, but i don't know where the fuck i'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we puttin in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggaz
Anybody killa, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggaz on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, "yo daz, what's up with the pound?
Is that nigga snoop alright? aiyyo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggaz in jail, or are them niggaz through?"
I said, if you ain't up on thangs
Snoop dogg is the name, dogg pound's the game
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggaz know
What's up with you i represent the pound and death row
And can't no other motherfucker in l.a. or long beach
And compton, and watts, see d-o-g's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the g of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
Pump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker, creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the pound is

[rbx] suicide, it's a suicide [4x]

[verse two: snoop doggy dogg]

The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the dogg pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon cuz
I drops bombs like platoon (ay nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and i promise i won't leave you
(i won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, cuz you don't wanna be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell
Well...

[rbx] suicide, it's a suicide [4x]

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa

(wake up in the morning, to lucky charms cereal)

[verse three: rbx]

Deep, deep like the mind of minolta, now picture this!
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And i got the machine, that cracks your fuckin chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then i release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the x
Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be livin
Word to momma, emma, drama, dilemma

[rbx] suicide, it's a suicide [4x]

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa

(wake up in the morning, to lucky charms cereal)

There's this girl, and, i see her every day
But she don't know me (she don't know my name)
And it ain't all that strange to me
Cause i know hers, and, it won't be long
'til she's convinced that i'm her man
The one that's gon' take her away

[nelly]
Yo, yo, yo
Hey yo it's three in the mornin and the party's still goin
Bass still knockin, pimp juice still flowin
'tics in the back, you can smell the chronic blowin
I got girls all around, i got my hef' game goin
Baby girl right but her partner got ass
Baby girl left but her partner got ass
She got 'em stuffed in them boy shorts covered up with lil' hearts
Her partner got 'em laced, cut right below the waist
You can tell they got taste by they ensemble
One like to salsa, the other the mambo
Why settle for one when i can have the combo?
Why do cancun when i can go to cabo?
They like to work out, and i ain't talkin tae*bo
They like fast cars, i ain't talkin volvos
They both are the devil but they like it diablo
Don't worry got it covered just listen to ronald

[chorus]
There's this girl, and, i see her every day
But she don't know me (she don't know my name)

The one that's gon' take her away

[snoop dogg]
Hmm, she say them suckers agitate her, told her i'm a regulator
Man i wanna lay down witcha, maybe we can do it later
I ain't got no time to waste, another move i got to make
Cold thang, she ain't even know my nizzame (damn)
I didn't even have to say it, baby wanna stop and play it
Rewind that, pop and grind that
You'll find that, a woman like yourself can't keep comin by yourself
Get in where you fit in, now enjoy yourself
Cute brightskin brownskin take me to the mountain
Get you wet like a fountain
Then get your counselin, have a seat have a drink have a toke
It's a +doggy dogg world+, you can have whatever you want
... or whatever you need, all you got to do it follow my lead
Take my hand, and roll with me
And live it up, with a d-o-double-g, lavishly

[chorus]
There's this girl, and, i see her every day

And it ain't all that strange to me
Cause i know hers, and, it won't be long
'til she's convinced that i'm her man
The one that's gon' take her away
She dont know my name
(you dont know my name)
She dont know my name
(you dont know my name)
She dont know my name
(oooohhh)
She dont know my name
(she dont know my name... aww babe)...

Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage

Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like rerun, your pockets look like raj

It's the same story, a nigga rich
I'm on some nigga shit, and yo' nigga bitch
You better check him, tell him I'm off the chain
I buck and bang, homie that's on the gang
Oh I ain't got a problem, you see me gettin' stacks
You see I bought the phantom, 24's don't come with that
I've been around the world, check grip in every state
Yo' bitch don't like me, she fake, some people might call it hate
But I don't give a damn, a bosses life is how I make that bread
Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich and have yo' bitch make my bed
My pockets fat as shit, you niggaz mad as shit
Pumps neither one of us, I'm on some gladys shit
Many have tried and failed, shit I'm out on bail
I make more cheese than your old man and he went to yale
Shit I went to jail, you can go to hell
You got some shit to tell? I got some shit for sale

(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like rerun, your pockets look like raj

Candypaint drippin', look at all them bags
Had to show and brag, 'cause bein' broke's a drag
I gotta get this paper, my kids they gotta eat
We got a lot of heat, just case them dollars cease
Been out for ballin', shot callin' I make that change
And I don't want the range, chop that trey on thangs
That's how them gangstas do it, we get our green in bricks
We put our green in blunts, you spend your green on chicks
I'm on some player shit, dynasty, straight laker shit
Cook it up on some baker shit and chop it up for some paper bitch
I got my mind right, and my money right
If you ain't in the game for the money you the funny type
And I'm laughin' my ass off, phantom with the mask off
Legal so they hatin' when I gas off
You know how snoopy does it, phantom don't bitch touch it
One hundred thousand a show, I'm gettin' doe like fuck it

(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like rerun, your pockets look like raj

Look how that flag hangin', gangbang and I ain't no punk
Maintain 'til that thang come out the trunk, make that k go pump-pump-pump
I'm bout my business boy, makin' money never been so smooth
Your bitch you 'bout to lose, 'cause she about to choose
And that's the way it goes, s-n double-one
You want that quiet type, I want that trouble hoe
Now go get paper girl, yeah I meant for real
One time I told a bitch not to come back 'til she got $2, 000 in $2 bills
That's cold game, the whole thang
I'm high as soul plane, I smoked the whole thang
You know how daddy do it, I'm true to it
I take a cocaine buick and put some blue to it
That's some gangsta shit, these hoes love this gangsta dick
Khakis and some gangsta kicks, yeah bitch that's my gangsta fit
I'm ballin' boy, and you ain't got to ask
She all about this pimpin', I'm all about this cash

(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like rerun, your pockets look like raj
(I got, I got, I got, I got)
My pockets look like rerun, your pockets look like raj

[Introduction](Snoop Dogg)
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, right?

(Dr. Dre) Oh for sho', check me out
[Verse 1](Dr. Dre)
It's still Dre Day , A.K.
Before I chrome the lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? My last album was "The Chronic"
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

(Snoop Dogg) (Singing)
If you ain't up on pace

(Dr. Dre)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, repping 213
Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

[Chorus] (Snoop Dogg)(2x)
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
(Dr. Dre)
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

[Verse 2](Dr. Dre)
Since the last time you heard from me I lost a friend
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop
It's "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematic
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

[Chorus]

[Verse 3](Dr. Dre)
It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
(Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Try to be the king but the ace is back

[Snoop] (Singing)
So if you ain't up on thangs

(Dr. Dre)
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

[Chorus x1.5]

[Conclusion] (Snoop)
Like that, right back up in ya
'95 plus four pennies
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky
A little weed, put it in the air
For you's a fool D.R.

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

[Snoop Dogg:]
Concentrated, everyday I'm faded
Tree's prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now
Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in the zig zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black car, sack a dank
High school nigga what the fuck you think
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors
And everyday I'm high as a motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Join roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
Cause I put that game all in her hair
She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big
And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubberbands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga getting bread, why knock it

[Chorus:]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

In highschool, we do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
We welcome you to highschool
We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
Get high to it

[Chorus:]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

Shit, there he go right there

[snoop dogg]
I don't say much
I don't say alize, no i don't say dutch
Keep yo' hands off until i say, okay touch
I never come off tacky, i'm a boss exactly
I'm like the slick suit snooperfly versace
Conversation flashy, y'all niggaz can't match me
I talk to you slow, so your game can roll
Take advice from a player, don't love her just play her
Boy i never could dare, to pay double the fare
Man i swear to god it's gon' be some trouble in here
Before i pay that bitch, i'm like a bossy hog
Half dog, half gorilla, bitch donkey kong
Niggaz thirst for hoes, i got a thirst to ball
Tryin to knock a pimp's hustle, be the first to fall
Fuckin with a-hundred-fifty, whole can of vodka
Mixed with gangbang, got a program like poppa (hey hold up man)
I'ma do you a favor, let this pimpin save ya
Leave that bitch alone, the homies call her ms. behavior
Boy you move too fast, done too much talkin
I'm too much walkin to one who keep hoes hawkin
Don't fuck with snoop too much cause he goes off when
Niggaz mouth too much, so please no flossin
I step up quicker, cause the game don't pause
I gotta stay sucka free, cause it ain't no laws
Dig this y'all

[chorus: snoop dogg]
That's the bidness mayne, step my game up up in this mayne
Long hours hard minutes mayne, with this hustle on splendid mayne
P.a. perfect attendance mayne

[snoop dogg]
Cause i'm a boss..
Yeah, real bossy like, and sometimes flossy
And if you fuckin with that
{"i-i know, i, i-i-know, i know you gonna dig this"}

I had to tell you the truth homey, but you got mad
Yeah i hurt yo' feelings, fuck it, it's too damn bad
I'm a major player, i got major game
I might floss a different bitch, but the pimpin the same
I ain't got time for no haters, i lay 'em flat on they back
I'm from the dogg pound homey, i don't fuck with them cats
I fuck with, niggaz, who be bustin them shots
I'm talkin long beach, inglewood, compton, watts
Close your chops, i knows your spots
Keep talkin nigga i'll expose your knots
You ain't ready for daddy, boy i do this for fun
It's like you versus kobe ballin one on one
You ain't got no chance, you ain't got no fans
I kick the shit out you punk, look momma no hands
I'm not a, holy roller but i pray so hard
Help me, i'm sendin these bitch niggaz straight to god
Shit i'm too damn grown, conversation is sho't
While your talk is funny, jack i talk with money
Keep the chain on bling, the rock is sunny
For you smart mouthted bitches i ain't that dummy
{"hell no," he replied}

[chorus]

{"god damn!"} {"let me tell you somethin"}

[chorus]

[snoop dogg]
That's the bidness, that's the bidness

Bailin through the eastside, feelin like a younger g

Fucka - I'm back to the party

Becky, and vicky, beggin me to give me hickeys
Through my dickies

Lil' mama tryin to show the dogg her g-string
While she sang ain't "nuthin' but a 'g' thang"
A nigga throwin signs tryin to let me know that he bang
Like I give a motherfuck what he claim
Ay - your nigga better chill doggy
'Fore I treat him like a old bitch and menopause him
I'll stop your ass right there
I swear had homies on your head like hair
Homie I ain't thinkin, I'm too busy drinkin
Plumber of the month, mami show me where your sink is
So I can get to uncloggin
I hope that lil' cat ready for this bigg dogg and woof!
Pause... Pause... Pause

Look, I'm just a young nigga
In the biz with mo' enemies than friends
Get no money goin out, but I got it comin in
And nah, I ain't a g but every day that's what I spend
I get paid to drop a verse, for 16 I need ten
End.. All the speculation
Them pre-conceived notions got me over-compensatin
And for you slow niggaz that mean not been concentratin
I'm shittin on these records while you rappers constipated
Uhh, it's get money, fuck haters

Me and snoop dogg is sir charles and king david
With problem we all ballin like the '09 lakers
Yeah, it's terrance martin on the track

You wanna be with other bitches, go be with other bitches
You don't need to be with me, the fuck?
Leave me the fuck alone

[Nate Dogg]
Seems like wintertime in June
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]
Girl, I just wanna lay and chill wit'chu
You're more than a summer fling and I was wondering
Can we go back to makin' love
The way we did when I was fresh out?

[Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
Ooh, baby
Now you got a nigga stressed out
I just wanted to be cool

[Nate Dogg]
Seems like wintertime in June
After all we've been through

All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Snoop Dogg]
Girl, you say I just wanna hang out with my crew
But, girl, you know I'm hustlin' to bring you everything
But you act like it ain't enough
I gave a fuck but now I'm fresh out

[Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
Ooh, baby
Now you got a nigga stressed out
I just wanted to be cool

[Nate Dogg]
Seems like wintertime in June (seems like)
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]
Wintertime with my baby
It's cold, bring that thang close to me like we're supposed to be
Can we go back to makin' love?
But ain't no condom left, I'm fresh out (ooh, baby)
We can have a baby and figure the rest out
I just need you to be cool

[Nate Dogg]
Seems like wintertime in June (wintertime)
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon (dark before it's noon)
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]
Wintertime (it will change)
With my baby (feelings change)
Wintertime in June
I just need you to be cool
